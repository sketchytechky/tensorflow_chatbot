# Tensorflow Chatbot
Tensorflow Chatbot Demo by @Sirajology on [Youtube](https://youtu.be/SJDEOWLHYVo)

Overview
============
This is the full code for 'How to Make an Amazing Tensorflow Chatbot Easily' by @Sirajology on [Youtube](https://youtu.be/SJDEOWLHYVo). In this demo code, we implement Tensorflows [Sequence to Sequence](https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r0.12/tutorials/seq2seq/index.html) model to train a
chatbot on the [Cornell Movie Dialogue dataset](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/~cristian/Cornell_Movie-Dialogs_Corpus.html). After training for a few hours, the bot is able to hold a fun conversation.


Dependencies
============
* numpy
* scipy 
* six
* tensorflow **Version r0.12** (https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r0.12/get_started/os_setup.html)

Use [pip](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip) to install any missing dependencies

Setup
===========
  1.Install the dependencies that are required above  
  
  2.Follow steps in Data Folder to create the Movie Files 
  
  3.Follow instructions in Usage  
  

Usage
===========

To train the bot, edit the `seq2seq.ini` file so that mode is set to train like so

`mode = train`

then run the code like so

``python execute.py``

To test the bot during or after training, edit the `seq2seq.ini` file so that mode is set to test like so

`mode = test`

then run the code like so

``python execute.py``
